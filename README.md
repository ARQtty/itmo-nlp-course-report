## abstract
the problem of attitudes to disability in the media and social net-
works is little studied. People with disabilities are limited in their in-
teraction with the outside world. In the online environment, they face
ridicule. Unethical attitude is a broader category than toxicity. Un-
ethicality can hurt the disabled, but appear in the media. This paper
examines the identification of unethical attitudes in the Russian media
for 2019-2022 using machine learning models. Link to the project code:
